9o is GoSublime's command-shell, press `ctrl+9` or `super+9` activate it.

It has two basic concepts: commands and actions.

Commands
========

Type `# ` (hash/number sign/pound sign [space]) to begin a command sequence e.g. `# help`', then press enter to execute it.

Actions
=======

Filename and other actionable text are highlighted (usually bold).
Place the cursor over these areas and press `ctrl+dot`,`ctrl+g`' (or `super+dot`,`super+g` on OS X) to open the corresponding file.
Alternatively, press `ctrl+shift`', (or `super+shift` on OS X) and left-click.

Supported commands
==================

* help: Present documentation for 9o and its supported commands

* build: build the current package

* run: build the current package. If it's a regular package run its tests otherwise(package main)
		   execute it. e.g. `run` or `run -flag1 -flag2=abc`

* replay: like `run` but attempts to cancel any active executions before running

* go: run the `go` command e.g. `go help`

* sh: execute a shell command. 9o does not attempt to emulate or support you system's shell/command interpreter.
	Use this command run shell commands.
	Your shell, by default, is the default python shell which may not be what you want(doesn't load environment variables etc.).
	On Linux and OS X it's usually `/bin/sh` and on Windows `cmd.exe`. See the `shell` setting for more details.

* clear: clears the output panel

* tskill: lists or cancels active tasks.
	type `tskill` to get a list of active tasks and their summary

		[ tskill | done ]
			#t1 0:01:39 9o: pending

	type `tskill [TASK ID]` to cancel the task. The task is represented by #TASK_ID. (you will be prompted with an ok/cancel dialog to confirm the action)

		[ tskill t1 | done ]
			kill t1: yes

	the following aliases can be used in place of task ids:
		`tskill replay` kill the last instance of the replay command
		`tskill go` kill the last instance of the go command `go run` etc. note, however that this may fail to actually kill the executable being run by `go run`

* settings: list settings as seen by GoSublime.
	type `settings` to get a listing of all settings.
	type `setting [NAME1] [NAME2] ...` to the value of the listed names

* env: list environment variables as seen/generated by GoSublime.
	type `env` to get a listing of all environment vars usable by GoSublime.
	type `env [NAME1] [NAME2] ...` to the value of the listed names

* share: share the active view's content on play.golang.org

* hist: manage command history
	type `hist` to list all historical commands
	type `hist erase` to erase all historical commands

Executing commands
==================

When you run a command e.g. `replay`, its line is replaced with the command followed by and hour glass
and a new prompt is initialised. When the command completes a its output is printed and the hour glass
replaced with a summary.

	[ /go ] # replay
		|
		v
	[ replay ⌛ ]
	[ /go ] #
		|
		v
	[ replay | done: 2.987ms ]
		hello world
	[ /go ] #


Command History
===============

In the 9o autocompletion menu, old commands are listed in the (reversed) order they were last executed.
They are prefixed with a carret(^) e.g. `^1 replay`. In addition to being able to autocomplete them,
you can also expand them by their alias(without execution). To do so, type the alias and press [enter] e.g.

	[ /go ] # ^1

is replaced with:

	[ /go ] # replay


To expand and execute an old command by its alias, use two carrets e.g.

	[ /go ] # ^^1

executes the last command:

	[ `replay` | done: 2.557ms ]
		hello world
