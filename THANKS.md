This is the list of non-anonymous GoSublime donors and supporters (the thought counts as well).
Its purpose is to thank the many supporters of myself and GoSublime, so thank you all! :)

(If you donated anonymously and would like to be added, or would otherwise liked your entry to be updated(or removed) please contact me)
